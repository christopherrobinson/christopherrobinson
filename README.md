### Hello! I'm Christopher 👋🏻

I have **over eighteen years of professional experience** developing websites and applications of varying size and scale based on web-standard technologies; from clean coded HTML and reusable CSS components with responsive techniques and progressive enhancement, through to the modern headless web with **React**, **styled-components**, and **GraphQL** endpoints.

I am an **Umbraco Certified Expert** and have been creating Umbraco websites using ASP.NET (MVC, C#, Angular) for over 16 years. Although my own site is [built using Astro](https://astro.build/) and the source code is available on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/christopherrobinson/christopherrobinson.uk).

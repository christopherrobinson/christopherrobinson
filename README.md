### Hello, I'm Christopher ðŸ‘‹

I have **over sixteen years of professional experience** developing websites and applications of varying size and scale based on web-standard technologies; from clean coded HTML and reusable CSS components with responsive techniques and progressive enhancement, through to the modern headless web with **React**, **styled-components**, and **GraphQL** endpoints.

I am also an **Umbraco Certified Expert** (real-world experience from V4 through to the latest stable V10) and have been creating and maintaining Umbraco websites using ASP.NET (MVC, C#, Angular) for 11+ years.
